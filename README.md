  ## Description
  I was tasked with building out an employee directory using React. A table is used to display employees that can be filtered and sorted. The sorting/filtering was achieved using stateful components that filtered from a list of seed data. An axios api call retrieved random user data from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) and wrote to a json file. The employee information is displayed on the table via a map function. The first class method sorts employees by last name from A->Z when the 'name' header is clicked and the reverse (Z->A) when it is clicked again. The second method employs a search bar that can filter the found results by any category. 
  ## Installation
  A package json is included with all the necessary dependencies. The command ```npm i``` will install all necessary dependencies.
